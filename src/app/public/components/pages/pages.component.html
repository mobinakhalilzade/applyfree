                            Our edurank™ is the core ranking technology we use in our search engine. It can rank schools, school departments, advisors and many more educational entities based on their performance in helping students succeed. We continuously work with highly ranked
                            entities to unravel their methods in keeping their high rank and work with lower ranking entities to help them compete for higher rankings. All these works help nothing but increase the likelihood of students’ success.

                        <p>
                            Our media team is constantly creating artistic stories from fact-based success. Stories of continuing success as well as the stories of rising from failure. We tell inspiring stories on how good intent along with good work can take away failure and replace
                            it with success.
