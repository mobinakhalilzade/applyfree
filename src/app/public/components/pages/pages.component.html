                            Our edurank™ is the core ranking technology we use in our search engine. It can rank
                            schools, school departments, advisors and many more educational entities based on their
                            performance in helping students succeed. We continuously work with highly ranked
                            entities to unravel their methods in keeping their high rank and work with lower ranking
                            entities to help them compete for higher rankings. All these works help nothing but increase
                            the likelihood of students’ success.
